# BUTTPlugin-for-Winamp
Update song name from file for BUTT using Python, grabbing information from WinAmp

winamp.py taken from -- https://github.com/hugovk/winamp
winampGetInfo.py is original work

Steps for use:

1. To run the program, make sure winamp.py and winampGetInfo.py are in the same folder.
2. Make sure BUTTInfo.txt and the winampGetInfo.py are in the same folder. (Otherwise you'll need to change the pointer on file opening to the proper location)
3. Open up BUTT and begin streaming as normal. Under the STREAM tab of settings, browse and select the BUTTInfo.txt file. Make sure the checkbox for ACTIVATE is checked.
4. Double click on winampGetInfo.py and the program will begin running.
5. You should have something that looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/vvSFLux.png
6. Congrats! Assuming BUTT was working well before, you should now have Song & Artist info attached to your stream and displaying.
To see this working in action, check out https://imjohnwhy.com/ (my website) and click on the button to download a stream.pls file. This can be played in most media players (I generally use Media Monkey or VLC Media Player). The information should be displayed like this https://i.imgur.com/5k3vzxQ.png
